Run the main method of the `Redscare.java` file.

If this doesn't work, use the "run" button next to the main method in `Redscare.java` inside Visual Studio Code.

To recreate the `results.txt` file, use the pipe operator ">" when running the Redscare main method. I.e.
```
java Redscare.java > results.txt
```
